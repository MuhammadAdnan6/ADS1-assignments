# Introduction
Healthy sleep cycle is essential for both mental and physical well-being, impacting student's educational performance. Various studies shows that insufficient sleep is a major problem in students. This problem affects attention, learning habits, and emotional stability, which are crucial for academic success. Sleep-deprived students often find it challenging to retain information, making it difficult to recall information both the short and long term. Poor sleep patterns cause stress, depression, irritability which further hampers learning and concentration. The focus of this analysis is to analyze the factors impacting student's sleep patterns and their impact on sleep quality and academic performance. The objective is to draw meaningful insights for improving sleep quality and better academic outcomes.
